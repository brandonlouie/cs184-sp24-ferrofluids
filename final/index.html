  Abstract
</h2>

<p>
  Ferrofluids are fluids containing magnetic particles that react to the magnetic field surrounding them, generally introduced by magnets or induced via changes in electrical currents. 
  Ferrofluids were first invented by NASA in 1963 as a way to transport rocket fuel in weightless environments, and the current applications of these fluids in the real world involve 
  biosensing, medical imaging, energy harvesting and transfer, and vibration control. In this project, we attempt to simulate the behavior of ferrofluids, which would allow us to study
  its unique properties and apply it to many of the aforementioned real world applications. On this webpage, you will see our attempts at simulating basic ferrofluid-magnet interactions,
  where the fluid forms characteristic spikes reacting to introduced magnetic fields. There were three major parts to this project: fluid simulation (creating a basic fluid, represented
  as a collection of particles), magnetization (introducing magnets into our simulation and magnetizing/"ferro-izing" our fluid), and cube marching (creating a mesh over these particles to 
  make our simulation better resemble real-world fluids).

  Technical Approach
</h2> 

<h3 align="left">
  Framework
</h3>

<p>
  Our project uses Homework 4: Cloth Sim from UC Berkeley's Computer Graphics and Imaging course (CS184) as a basis for our fluid simulation. This homework assignment provides the framework 
  for mathematically based physical simulations, and more specifically focused on the simulation of cloth and its interactions with planes, spheres, and itself. We chose to use this assignment
  as our starting framework as our project is on a particle-based simulation, which is precisely what we implemented in this assignment; just as we can represent a cloth as a collection of
  particles connected with springs, we can express our fluid as a collection of particles that interact with each other with binding forces similar to springs. The major changes we made
  to this existing repository is updating the object to be simulated; we effectively replaced every file or instance specific to cloth simulation with our own files and definitions that specify
  the existence of a fluid object. The structure for our particle-based representation of fluids is heavily inspired "A Current Loop Model for the Fast Simulation of Ferrofluids" 
  by Shao, Huang, and Michels (linked below).

<h3 align="left">
  Fluid Simulation -- Divergence-Free Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics
</h3>

<p>
  For the fluid simulation, the model utilizes divergence-free smoothed particle hydrodynamics to simulate fluids and directly uses Bender et al's implementation for DFSPH. In an SPH fluid 
  simulation, there are a discrete number of particles that interact with one another. Each particle represents a distribution of particles around it represented by the kernel/weighting 
  function <i>W</i>. The kernel function is gaussian-like, radially symmetric, and compactly supported. Each discrete particle in the simulation maintains its position, velocity, density, 
  and mass, among other quantities. The value of a particular quantity at a point in space <b>r</b> inside the fluid can be obtained by interpolating the value of that quantity using the 
  kernel function as follows:
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  where <i>m_j</i> is the pass of the jth particle, ‚ç¥_j is the density of the jth particle, <i>A_j</i> is the desired quantity to be evaluated, <b><i>r</b>_j</i> is the 
  position of the jth particle, and <i>W</i> is the kernel  function with support proportional to a constant h. The density of a particle ‚ç¥_j is approximated using the following relation:
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_2.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  When the derivative of a field quantity is desired, the derivatives only apply to the kernel function <i>W</i> like so:
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_3.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  The above relations provide the means to evaluate a field quantity <i>A</i> at any arbitrary position <b>r</b>, but for the sake of the simulation, we only evaluate the relevant field quantities 
  at each of the particle positions <b>r_i</b>. It is also important to note that the sums in the above equations are over <i>surrounding</i> particles. That is, if we are evaluating the density of 
  the ith particle, ‚ç¥_i,  the term m_iW(r_i - r_i, h) = m_iW(<b>0</b>, h) is not included in the sum. Because the kernel function <i>W</i> is compactly supported (i.e., it evaluates to zero for a sufficiently 
  large radius R), isolated particles that are far enough from other particles will end up having their density evaluated to zero. This is an issue because we divide by the particle densities 
  of each particle to calculate other field quantities. To combat this, we offset the particle densities by a small constant 10^-6.
</p>

<p>
  At a high level, the simulation evaluates relevant quantities each of the particle locations, and then applies forces in order to satisfy the incompressible, 
  isothermal Navier-Stokes equation, which is equivalent to the following: 
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_4.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  At each timestep, we calculate the non-pressure forces (which come from viscosity, gravity, cohesion, curvature, and magnetism). We update the velocities and positions using basic Euler 
  integration. Then, we apply the relevant pressure forces to enforce incompressibility. That equates to updating the velocities of each particle to ensure that the density of the fluid 
  remains constant and that the fluid remains divergence free. The functions <b>correctDensityError()</b> and <b>correctDivergenceError()</b> each iteratively update the velocities of each 
  particle until they are within a small margin of error of satisfying those constraints.
</p>

<center><img src="images/algo_2.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<center><img src="images/algo_3.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  The two forces included in the fluid simulation are viscosity and surface tension. For the variables, m is mass and r is position. For the viscosity calculation, we calculated 
  it based on the following equation:
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_5.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  The kernel function we chose for viscosity was the W_spiky kernel taken from M√ºller et al. as it ran the fastest and gave us the best results.
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_6.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  For surface tension, it is based on this equation taken from Shao et al.:
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_7.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  Where f_cohesion and f_curvature are calculated with:
</p>

  ùúé is the surface tension coefficient and C denotes a spline function. In curvature, n_i and n_j correspond to their normals. The spline function came from the original 
  referenced paper by Akinci et al.

  <font size="-1">
    A diagram describing the forces present between fluid particles in a ferrofluid when exposed to a magnetic field
  </font>
</figcaption>

<p>
  Each particle in the fluid simulation can be thought of as a tiny magnet. In the absence of a magnet, the magnetic moments of each of the particles are randomly distributed, 
  so the fluid as whole behaves like any other. When exposed to an external magnetic field the magnetic moments of the particles align in a dominant direction and the spikes form. 
  The magnetic force computation can be broken down into two parts: evaluating the magnetic moment of each particle and then applying the magnetic force onto each particle. 
</p>

<p>
  The smoothing kernel function we use for the magnetic force is different from what we use in DFSPH:
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_11.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  In order to solve for the magnetic moments, we use the following relation:
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_12.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  The term on the left side of the equation has a linear relationship with the ith magnetic moment as follows (ùúí is a constant equal to the magnetic susceptibility of the fluid and 
  <i>V</i> = (Œîx)^3, where Œîx is the initial spacing between the particles when they are initialized in the shape of a cube):
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_13.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  The <b>H</b>(<b>r</b>_i - <b>r</b>_j, <b>m</b>_j) term inside the summation in equation (13) is also linear with respect to the jth magnetic moment, <b>m</b>_j:
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_14.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  Where W_avr(r) is the average value of the kernel function over the sphere of radius r. 
</p>

<p>
  This means that equation (13) can be written in the form of a matrix-vector product:
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_15.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<center><img src="images/equation_16.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  where <b>G</b> ‚àà R^(3Nx3N), <b>b</b>, <b>m</b> ‚àà R^3N, and <b>h_ext</b> ‚àà R^3N, and N is the total number of particles in the simulation. <b>h_ext</b> can be thought of as a 
  stacked vector of the 3D external magnetic field evaluated at each of the N particle positions. In our simulation, the magnetic field is uniform, so this vector can be thought of 
  as N stacked copies of the constant magnetic field we define. We solve for the vector <b>b</b>, which has a linear relationship with the magnetic moments vector <b>m</b>, in the least squares sense. 
  Because the matrix <b>G</b> is R^(3Nx3N), we don't bother calculating the closed form least squares solution because that would involve expensive matrix-matrix products and a matrix inversion computation. 
  Instead, we use the conjugate gradient method in order to iteratively improve on the least squares solution for the magnetic moments vector <b>m</b>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Conjugate gradient method</b> algorithm for solving a linear system <b>Ax</b> = <b>b</b>:
</p>

<center><img src="images/cgm.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  Once we have calculated the magnetic moments for each of the N particles, we apply the corresponding magnetic forces. The force between two particles is computed differently 
  depending on the distance between the two. For a source particle <i>s</i> and a target particle <i>t</i>, if the distance between them is less than 4h, we compute the force between them as 
  described in the section labeled <b>near-force computation</b>. Otherwise, we compute it as described in the section labeled <b>far-force computation</b>.
</p>

<br>

<h3 align="left">
  Near-force computation:
</h3>

<center><img src="images/near-force.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  The force from a source particle s to a target particle t if the distance between them is below 4h, where h is the kernel smoothing length. These integrals are evaluated numerically 
  in a relative coordinate system to form lookup curves which are used to speed up the computation. The lookup curves are fitted with piecewise fourth-order polynomials. We apply a 
  coordinate transformation so that the source particle gets mapped to the origin and the target particle gets mapped to (0, 0, qh), where <i>q</i> = r / h, and r is the distance between the 
  two particles. We then rotate the magnetic moments according to this new coordinate system. We compute the force in rotated coordinates as follows: 
</p>

<center><img src="images/equation_17.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  where terms with a ~ have been rotated to match the coordinate system described above. ùõº is the index of the component of the rotated force vector and ùõΩ and ùõæ are indices of the 
  rotated source and target magnetic moments, respectively. ùö≤ is a relatively sparse third-order tensor with 27 entries. Each entry can be thought of as a fitted polynomial curve 
  which approximates the integral in equation (29) for combination of two components of unit rotated magnetic moments of the two particles. The only non-zero entries of the tensor 
  are listed below:
</p>

<center><img src="images/tensor.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  Where C_i(q), where q = r / h and r is distance between the source and target particles, are piecewise fourth order polynomials fitted to approximate the force integral in the 
  rotated coordinate space written in equation (29).

  Important Notes on Magnetism:
</h3>

<p>
  The external magnetic field can also apply a magnetic force on the particles which we evaluate as follows: 
</p>

<center><img src="images/magforce.png" align="middle" width="400px"/></center>

<p>
  However, because we implement a constant external magnetic field, its gradient is zero and thus it does not apply a force on the particles.
</p>

<p>
  We are unable to simulate with large amounts of particles due to runtime constraints, so the far-force computation described above is actually never run in our implementation 
  (although it is in fact implemented). That is, because there are so few particles, there is never a case where two particles are farther than 4h from each other.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, because we have very few particles applying magnetic forces on each other, we need to make magnetic susceptibility ùúí massive in order to for the magnetic moments to 
  be large enough in magnitude for the magnetic forces between them to be visible in the simulation. Because the total magnetic force on a particular particle is a sum over all other 
  particles in the simulation, we believe that having more particles would have given rise to the fluid developing the characteristic look with multiple spikes even with a smaller magnetic 
  susceptibility.

  Optimizations to Fluid Simulation and Magnetism:
</h3>

<p>
  SPH simulations involve O(N^2) work since each of the N particles needs to iterate over all other (N - 1) particles to compute their contributions weighted by the smoothing kernel 
  function <i>W</i>. However, because the W_spiky(r) kernel we used has finite support (W_spiky(r) = 0 for r > h), we can actually skip over iterating over all N particles and instead 
  only iterate over nearby particles that have the potential to provide a non-zero contribution to our desired value.
</p>

<p>
  To do this, we divide the possible space that the fluid can occupy into cubes with side length h. The particles themselves are surrounded by 6 invisible planes oriented in the shape of a 
  cube. If a particle has a velocity that would cause it to cross over the plane from its current position when going to the next timestep, we zero the component of its velocity in the 
  direction of the plane's surface normal. These planes constrain the possible locations of a particle in the fluid throughout the simulation. This way, we can store subdivided space into 
  an array of lists, where the array length scales with the number of particles (we have it so the density of the fluid is the same no matter how many particles there are, so increasing the 
  number of particles also increases the size of the space the fluid occupies. We separate the bounding planes further to account for this). Each entry in the array represents a cubic cell 
  of side length h and stores a list of particles currently contained in that cell. Because the kernel support is equal to h and the cells are of width h, each particle only needs to search 
  the cell it is contained in plus all surrounding cells (27 cells in total) to find the particles that have the potential to have a non-zero contribution to their sum. As such, the 
  algorithmic work becomes O(NM), where M is the average number of particles in a cube with side-length 3h. When we compute the new positions for each particle at each time step, we move 
  them to their corresponding cell if they exited their old cell.
</p>

<p>
  Note: The array of cells is sparse. That is, we only allocate a list of particles corresponding to that cell if there is at least one particle occupying that cell. That is, 
  if the particles have all fallen due to gravity and only occupy the bottom third of the space, only one third of the lists in the cells array will be allocated in memory.
</p>

<p>
  We are unable to utilize this optimization for the magnetic force computation because a magnetic force is applied between all pairs of particles even if they are farther away 
  from each other than the kernel support (see <b>far-force computation</b>). As a result, the magnetic force computation remains O(N^2). This makes it difficult to run our algorithm 
  with large numbers of particles.
</p>

  Cube Marching

<figcaption align="middle">
  <font size="-1">
    A diagram illustrating the cube marching process
  </font>
</figcaption>

<p>
  In order to transform the collection of fluid particles into a 3D texture, we used the cube marching algorithm.
  This was implemnted by seperating the world into cubes, and at each vertex determining whether that point was "underfluid".
  This was determined by whether the given vertex intersected a fluid particle.
  Then, once this boolean cube mesh was generated, each cube was categorized as a permutation of the cases shown above, and the resulting triangle were generated and placed in a mesh.
  This final mesh was outputed frame by frame into a .obj file for each frame, containing vertex, normals, and faces.

  Rendering (via Blender)

<figcaption align="middle">
  <font size="-1">

</figcaption>

<p>
  Once the triangle meshes were generated, we used the blender add-on "stopmotionOBJ" to stitch together the meshes into an animation.
  A black glossy BSDF was added to the material to emulate that of ferrofluid.
  We noticed that cube marching looked kind of blocky, so we added some smoothing to the mesh in order to better match the appearance of a thick liquid. 
</p>

<br>

<h3 align="left">
  Problems encountered
</h3>

<p>
  The first problem we encountered was creating a stable fluid simulation. We read through many different papers and tried to implement multiple versions of SPH, but we ended up 
  implementing DFSPH. It took us more than half of the 4 weeks allotted to work on the project to get a reasonably working fluid simulation. Afterward, we spent a lot of time tuning 
  parameters and testing different kernel functions to observe the effect. This took a lot of time but we eventually found values we were satisfied with. Additionally, our fluid simulation 
  ran very slow, so we spent a lot of time coming up with a neighborhood search to increase the speed of the fluid simulation.
</p>

<p>
  The biggest challenge we faced was testing our implementation. It was difficult to test individual parts of the simulation in isolation because it is hard to say what the behavior was 
  supposed to look like if only one part of the simulation was active. Additionally, sometimes the simulation would only diverge if all parts were active, which made it difficult to tell 
  which part we had incorrectly implemented. 
</p>

<p>
  The magnetic force computation was also hard to get working. It was impractical to test the solution for a large number of particles due to the long runtime, but sometimes the simulation 
  would only diverge for a larger number of particles. Also, it was difficult to know what the expected behavior was supposed to be for a smaller number of particles. 
</p>

<p>
  The conjugate gradient method described earlier uses an iterative computation to evaluate the residual vector, but this was prone to floating point error build up which was causing our 
  simulation to blow up for certain particle counts. As such, we began to explicitly calculate the residual vector with a matrix-vector product at each iteration in the algorithm at the 
  cost of having a longer runtime.
</p>

<p>
  When implementing cube marching, we ran into several smaller problems, but the most notable was performance. Out initial implementation used primitive arrays and used duplicate vertices for each triangle,
  which caused longer mesh construction times. After refactoring different parts of the process, this operation was significantly hastened, allowing us to generate higher quality meshes and final renderings.
</p>

<p>
  When using blender, there were not explicit problems that slowed us down for any significant amount of time, but there was a tough learning curve on using the software because none of us had any previous experience with it.
  The most diffiult challenge to overcome was figuring out how to properly position and configure the camera to generate an adequate but timely rendering.
</p>

<br>

<h3 align="left">
  Lessons Learned
</h3>

<p>
  One key takeaway was the importance of tuning your parameters and choosing the correct kernel functions. There were many instances where the issues we were running into were not with 
  what we implemented, but the kernel functions and parameters we were using. Additionally, fluid simulations and magnetization are extremely computationally heavy, making it difficult 
  to get a truly accurate large-scale simulation without utilizing CUDA, among other optimizations. None of us had any experience with fluid simulations or magnetization, making the 
  project difficult, but we gained a deeper understanding of the different fluid simulation methods and magnetization.

    Final Results (with smoothing)
  </font>
</figcaption>

<p>
  For our final result, we rendered 216 particles and applied a glossy black BRDF. We first simulated the cube of ferrofluid falling and splashing on the sides without magnetization. 
  Once the fluid reaches a rest state, we activate the magnet which causes the fluid to converge to the center and form a spike. We then disable the magnet to let the fluid splash down 
  again. We provide two animations, one with the raw meshes we generated, and another where we smooth out the mesh. Due to constraints on computational power, our simulation is rather 
  small scale. As a result, the render we present above features only one spike, but with access to greater computational power and further optimizations, we believe that our simulation 
  would more accurately resemble a real-world ferrofluid.

  Contributions
</h2>

<p>
  This project was a collaboration between Aidan Garde, Andres Avella, Andrew Nguyen, and Brandon Louie, a group of four students graduating from UC Berkeley in Spring of 2024. Aidan
  implemented the cube marching algorithm that enabled our fluid simulation to look more visually appealing and similar to real-world fluids, and assisted with parts of the fluid 
  simulation. Andres and Andrew led the implementation of the fluid simulation and magnetization of the fluid, reading many of the research papers on ferrofluids and fluid simulation and
  building our ferrofluid using these papers as a guideline. Brandon assisted in various aspects of the project, assisting the other group members with tasks related to fluid simulation
  and magnetization, and developed many of the materials for the milestone and final deliverables for this project. Each member equally contributed to our final project, each working on the 
  implementation tasks assigned to them and writing about the results of the work they completed.

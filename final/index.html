  Abstract
</h2>

<p>
  Ferrofluids are fluids containing magnetic particles that react to the magnetic field surrounding them, generally introduced by magnets or induced via changes in electrical currents. 
  Ferrofluids were first invented by NASA in 1963 as a way to transport rocket fuel in weightless environments, and the current applications of these fluids in the real world involve 
  biosensing, medical imaging, energy harvesting and transfer, and vibration control. In this project, we attempt to simulate the behavior of ferrofluids, which would allow us to study
  its unique properties and apply it to many of the aforementioned real world applications. On this webpage, you will see our attempts at simulating basic ferrofluid-magnet interactions,
  where the fluid forms characteristic spikes reacting to introduced magnetic fields. There were three major parts to this project: fluid simulation (creating a basic fluid, represented
  as a collection of particles), magnetization (introducing magnets into our simulation and magnetizing/"ferro-izing" our fluid), and cube marching (creating a mesh over these particles to 
  make our simulation better resemble real-world fluids).

    An example of a ferrofluid being exposed to a magnet. The magnet (not pictured) lies beneath the ferrofluid, creating a magnetic field. The magnetic particles in the ferrofluid contour
    to the direction of the magnetic field, creating the characteristic spikes pictured here. When the magnet is removed, the ferrofluid appears similar to most other liquids at rest.

  Technical Approach
</h2> 

<p>
  Our project uses Homework 4: Cloth Sim from UC Berkeley's Computer Graphics and Imaging course (CS184) as a basis for our fluid simulation. This homework assignment provides the framework 
  for mathematically based physical simulations, and more specifically focused on the simulation of cloth and its interactions with planes, spheres, and itself. We chose to us this assignment
  as our starting framework as our project is on a particle-based simulation, which is precisely what we implemented in this assignment; just as we can represent a cloth as a collection of
  particles connected with springs, we can express our fluid as a collection of particles that interact with each other with binding forces similar to springs. The major  we made
  to this existing repository is updating the object to be simulated; we effectively replaced every file or instance specific to cloth simulation with our own files and definitions that specify
  the existence of a fluid object. The structure for our particle-based representation of fluids is heavily inspired "A Current Loop Model for the Fast Simulation of Ferrofluids" 
  by Shao, Huang, and Michels (linked below).

  Contributions
</h2>

<p>
  This project was a collaboration between Aidan Garde, Andres Avella, Andrew Nguyen, and Brandon Louie, a group of four students graduating from UC Berkeley in Spring of 2024. Aidan
  implemented the cube marching algorithm that enabled our fluid simulation to look more visually appealing and similar to real-world fluids, and assisted with parts of the fluid 
  simulation. Andres and Andrew led the implementation of the fluid simulation and magnetization of the fluid, reading many of the research papers on ferrofluids and fluid simulation and
  building our ferrofluid using these papers as a guideline. Brandon assisted in various aspects of the project, assisting the other group members with tasks related to fluid simulation
  and magnetization, and developed many of the materials for the milestone and final deliverables for this project. Each member equally contributed to our final project, each working on the 
  implementation tasks assigned to them and writing about the results of the work they completed.
